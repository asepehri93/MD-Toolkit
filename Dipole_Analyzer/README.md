Introduction
============

The module Dipole_Analyzer is developed to perform **total-** and
**local-polarization analysis** on the results of MD-simulations. The module is
a part of ReaxFF toolkit repository which aims to provide python modules to
facilitate MD-simulation and force field training objectives through **ReaxFF**
platform. This module was developed as part of my research in **The Pennsylvania
State University** focused on **Invoked Ferroelectricity in Mg-doped ZnO**. To
see usage examples, please see the framework section below.
